I have to learn these things in the order of most important to least.

- Become comfortable with the new laptop
- Learn some basic stuff about linux
    - Like how to install stuff
    - how to switch directory
    - how to list directory
    - Ubuntu/elementary OS
    - how to start programs
    - learn how to start hugo website
- learn git
- Learn to type (typeracer for practice)
- Learn Markdown (google it)

Habits:

- 1 new post everyday
    - the file name should be the date
    - example october-30.md
    - write everything you learnt that day
- at least learn 3 new things everyday
- practice everyday
